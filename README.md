# UI Experiments
Series of UI Experiments as presented by Gary Simon, full stack developer and web designer.
I've created this repository to test myself and replicate the examples made by Gary Simon in his YouTube Channel.
I will try to update this everytime with each video.

Stay tuned and go checkout his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow)!
